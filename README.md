This is the source code for [Indycast](http://indycast.net), a DVR for independent radio. 

It's built so you can subscribe to your favorite shows and listen on your time, not airtime.

Stations are supported through the generosity of a volunteer network of servers around the world.

You can help by

 * [Donating money to help cover the costs](https://github.com/kristopolous/DRR/wiki/Donating-Money)
 * [Running a server](https://github.com/kristopolous/DRR/wiki/Join-the-Federation)
 * [Fixing bugs in the software](https://github.com/kristopolous/DRR/issues)
 * [Giving us an account on an existing server](https://github.com/kristopolous/DRR/wiki/Donating-Servers).

You can also [see the current network](https://github.com/kristopolous/DRR/wiki/Current-Architecture) and costs.

Mailing list is [on google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/indycast)

Thank you.
